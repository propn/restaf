# Lazy Programmer Guide - Part II: create-react-restaf-viya-app  

Introduction:

In the previous two articles titled <x> and </x> I discussed how three librarires restaf, restaflib and restaf-server can help you develop applications with
minimal effort. If you jump start your application with this tool, you will start writing applications that make REST API calls to SAS Viya using restaf. 
All it takes is to enter
<pre>
    npx create-react-restaf-viya-app your-app-name
</pre>
If you are a fan of creating your app with other tools do not despair -  you can import restaf and restaflib into your application and start using them just the way
you would any other javascript library.
