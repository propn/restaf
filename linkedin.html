Lazy Programmer Guide - Part II

Hello SAS Viya Applicaton Developers:
In a recent posts titled "Lazy Programmer's Guide to Developing SAS Viya Applications"(https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kdevakumar_lazy-programmers-guide-to-developing-sas-activity-6682032029325946880-7t6h)
and "Rapid Web Application Deployment" I presented ways to be very productive with minimal coding. These are building blocks to developing useful
applications.
In keeping with the theme of lazy programmers, I just published a tool create-react-restaf-viya-app(https://github.com/sassoftware/restaf/blob/2.0.0/packages/createApp/README.md) to help you jump start your react-based Viya applications. This tool
is an extension of the very popular create-react-app(https://create-react-app.dev) from Facebook.

Hope you find this addition to toolbox useful.
